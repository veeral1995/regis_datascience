       "['With Biden saying the US will have enough vaccines for every adult by the end of the May, how open do you think international travel for Americans will be this summer?',\n",
       " 'Short version: I am very very much hoping to travel from the US to Europe this summer, likely for \\\\~6 weeks in the June/July/August range. Location flexible, thinking likely Iceland and perhaps Scandinavia. Everything with COVID is looking up but still uncertain right now. How should I be going about planning/booking this?\\n\\nDetail: This would be with my girlfriend, both US-only citizens, both healthy 26-yos. Obviously, times are tough and unpredictable, but unfortunately my timing is not super flexible (it is within that window but can\\'t be later). I am beginning graduate school in the fall and for years have been looking at this summer as a uniquely excellent opportunity to do a big big trip. I have been lucky enough to travel a lot through my young life (40+ countries), but with corporate crunches on vacation time in recent and future years, family o\\'clock not too far off, and this being a big transition point in our lives that would be nice to have a big vacation in there, I am very insistent on making as great a trip as possible happen this summer (and am also very mindful of being safe/considerate/reasonable/etc.).\\n\\nI have been locked into COVID news and feel increasingly confident that we will be vaccinated by the time this trip would happen. European countries will almost certainly be behind the US in progress but still reasonably far along. There is talk of vaccine passports, but little concrete right now and unclear if movement will be restricted to EU citizens/residents or if us crazy Americans will be welcome. This feels like the type of thing that could be announced as soon as next week or could take until May/June or could have multiple steps between now and then. The answer to all \"CAN I TRAVEL TO EUROPE THIS SUMMER?\" questions - as this sort of is - is \"we don\\'t know.\" I fully get that.\\n\\nAbsent COVID variables, we would probably do something like 2 weeks in Iceland and 4 weeks across Scandinavian countries. (More detailed itinerary beyond that, I really couldn\\'t tell you as getting around to that is essentially the point of this post.) Furthermore, we think these locations would especially work well in late-COVID era as it would be a very nature-heavy trip. I am also thinking somewhere like Iceland specifically will be particularly eager to open up to tourists. All that said, we can completely pivot locations if elsewhere ends up being more feasible.\\n\\nWhere this nets out at is I am getting to the point where I need to start planning, but it\\'s still not clear if a trip to Europe can happen at all and not clear if there will be different rules for different countries. From looking through these threads over the past couple months, I know I am not alone in hoping for a summer trip. So, my questions I guess are both philosophical and practical.

I decided to go to India (or another hard place for a first time traveler) and I hate it. I\\'m cowering/crying/hiding in my hostel and just want to go home.\" \\n\\nSo before you go all out, you may want to start small and learn the basics of traveling in a more familiar setting.\\n\\nIf you really haven\\'t ever traveled before, try starting with being a tourist in your own city. Make a plan and budget, take public transportation and have a fun day.\\n\\nThen expand to a nearby city or tourist site, doing the same thing.\\n\\nThen start with a week to two weeks trip in a different state or even internationally. Many first time travelers might feel more comfortable going to a place that speaks their language, but remember, for touristy areas many in the tourism/hospitality industry will speak some English. So don\\'t feel limited to only English Speaking Countries.\\n\\nThis sub has a mostly hate/dislike of group tours as you are limited and its more expensive, but for first time travelers or those wanting to cover a lot of ground in a short amount of time, small group tours can be that first stepping stone. Common age specific tour companies are G Adventures, Intrepid, Contiki, TopDeck, etc.  \\n\\nIf you aren\\'t into Group Tours, try a day trip tour provider, like ones found on the aggregator Viatour. \\n\\nOnce you\\'ve done the above you likely will feel more confident in going out on your own (like /r/solotravel) and for longer periods of time.\\n\\nAnd remember, you don\\'t HAVE to like travel.

       " '**Emergency Funds**\\n\\nThis is my soapbox advice for any new traveler on limited funds: \"You should travel with emergency funds\". You should never be in a position that one missed bus means you cannot eat. You cannot rely on free/in trade housing/food. You should always have enough money to get yourself home. Especially in the COVID world, being able to get a plane home before borders closed was important. It is also a good idea if you can to have a \"re-entry fund\" to support yourselves when you return home. Money for short term apartment, utilities, food etc while you look for a long term place & work.\\n\\nAnd wanting the freedom of travel does not reduce the amount of planning, budgeting, and research you should be doing. You\\'ll need to know the visa requirements of anywhere you want to go. How long you can stay. Know that you cannot work on a tourist visa or visa waiver, and yes that includes volunteering or \"trade\" such as free housing/food.',\n",

One recommendation I have is to look into visas, etc. when traveling internationally. Beyond visas, many countries require proof of onward travel. Be sure to research to see if the countries you are traveling to require this, as it can help you avoid an unpleasant surprise at the airport. As far as budget goes, Southeast Asia is a great place for cheap travel. I don't recommend going anywhere now due to COVID. As far as working goes, I personally preferred working at home and saving money for a period of time, then traveling for a period of time. I was able to afford trips to Europe, Western US, and Southeast Asia by working as a server in between and trying to save as much as I could.

       " '**Words on Voluntourism / Volunteering**\\n\\n*Note: This is a copy/paste of things I\\'ve written before.*\\n\\nA few things to consider:\\n\\n* Volunteering in most countries is still considered work, and that requires a proper work visa. Yes, even for trade (as in for room and board) is still considered working.\\n\\n* Unless you have specific in-demand skills, you are likely taking away a job from a local.\\n\\n* Don\\'t turn a \"cultural experience\" or \"helping the less fortunate\" into a human zoo. Especially if it is \"working with children\". There have been horror stories of children being taken from their families or kept kids out of school in order for orphanages to have enough children on hand for volunteers to \"work with\". Even if it is a legit orphanage with actual orphaned children, you are likely doing more psychological harm to the children by being a part of the revolving/ever changing people in their lives.\\n\\n* Isn\\'t it strange that all those \"sloth sanctuaries\" in Costa Rica, and other type of \"Non-Zoos\" type experiences ALWAYS have cute baby animals on hand? Or cages full of animals for you to interact with? Research the hell out of any of these experiences, and also think to yourself \"Am I a certified exotic animal veterinarian?\" If the answer is no, you are likely contributing to a harmful organization.\\n\\n* You said \"I\\'m really interested...be able to afford that travel.\" and \"I\\'m...a recent grad with not a crazy amount of funds\". \"without being a part of the voluntourism but still being affordable\" Are you under the impression that you are going to be paid for your volunteering time? Nearly all organizations are going to charge you a lot for the experience. Why? Because you lack skills. You aren\\'t in demand. They aren\\'t looking for your physical help, they want your money. They would be thrilled to instead receive cold hard cash as a donation. So instead they\\'ve packaged up a product, an experience, to make you feel like you are doing something (but again likely not helping or just taking a job away from a local). This is especially true for anywhere you are volunteering less than 6 months for. Why? Because it costs a lot to train people to do a job. Those staying under a month are likely costing the organization money. You are a drain on their resources. So that is why they charge a lot of money. They are trying to recoup the costs and interruption your visit incurs.\\n\\nSo the bottom line is, you seem to be looking to lessen the costs of travel while you still \"making an impact\". You can\\'t. You don\\'t have any true skills to help.\\n\\nThe best thing you can do is what others have said. Research the hell out of every activity you do and weigh the impact of it. Not just on local culture, but also on a global scale. Monitor how much trash you generate while traveling. Figure out a way to dispose/recycle it appropriately. Support locals by spending your money at their businesses NOT by taking away jobs from those in their community. If you are looking for a cultural experience, there are organizations for that (Sister Cities is one I did, I did an exchange to Japan) that aren\\'t tied with volunteering. And there are numerous language schools in the areas you are looking at for you to learn their language (at a cost of course.)\\n\\nSo the underlying reasons you say you want to experience/learn are out there. It just is that everyone is better off if you spend money on these experiences.\\n\\nCopied from this thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/bymqcw/volunteering_working_traveling_abroad_is_it/',\n",

       " 'I figure as a well traveled 23 year old (typically solo traveling) I can impart some wisdom for those around my age looking to travel. In no particular order:\\n\\n- TRY to budget. If you go into a trip totally blind, you\\'ll get burned and run out of money. If you go into the trip with a bit of an idea at least, it\\'ll be easier to plan\\n\\n- But of course, that all depends on how you travel. Are you okay with bare bones street meals, or so you want a step up once a day or you? Are you okay with the cramped 2+3 seating of a high speed train in China, or do you want 2+2? (Do the 2+2 trust me.) You\\'ll learn to account for these while you travel, but when first starting out you\\'ll need...\\n\\n- An emergency fund. I typically do $250 for every $1000 I budget, but I like to be flexible in my plans (cancel this ticket for $50 because someone you met wants to travel with you to a different city than you planned, etc.) You may be fine with less, but you WILL need one. Things won\\'t go as planned, and while these do make the best stories down the line, they\\'ll be expensive now. So plan for them.\\n\\n- On that same note, DONT BRING JUST ONE BANK CARD! Imagine how fun it is being in Chiang Rai Thailand waking up to find out your only debit card was stolen back home (hint: it\\'s not.) Bring a credit card at least, ideally Visa as they\\'re accepted all over the place, but a second bank card would be ideal. A credit card can also be used to bail you out of emergency situations if necessary, but it\\'s not ideal to go into debt. Ideally budget for it.\\n\\n- Onto things other than budget, /u/jadeoracle has it absolutely right with the \"try starting with being a tourist in your own city\" advice (but I say maybe try another city in your own country also.) If you go balls deep in a foreign country for your first trip, you\\'ll be in for a hell of a surprise. Easy yourself into it (and for a foreign place, if it\\'s a place with a different culture, start yourself with the most international city for a few days. It\\'s most likely where you\\'re flying into anyways, and it\\'s a good way to familiarize yourself without being too thrown into the mix.)\\n\\n- Read up on scams and stuff in the country. Never go anywhere with someone you just met.\\n\\n- Read up on visa rules too. Don\\'t get caught slackin at the border. Have your shit together, and make sure you have EVERYTHING if you feel like you\\'ll need it (now some countries don\\'t enforce all their border rules all the time, so if you feel like you can get away with it great, but don\\'t bet on it.)\\n\\n- If you start as young as I did (19), you\\'ll likely be the youngest, if not the youngest person in the hostel. Learn to embrace it, don\\'t act awkward and people won\\'t treat you awkward.\\n\\n- Wear a fucking condom. Seriously. You know what\\'s worse than being in a remote part of a country with poor medical resources and having the most painful pissed of your life? (This didn\\'t happen to me personally but a friend, do you know why it didn\\'t happen to me? Because condoms!)\\n\\nFeel free to ask me if you have any questions, I\\'ve been to a ton of Asian countries (most of SEA plus a lot of time in China) as well as a few European ones.

Depending on where you're going, of course, but if you want to travel through Central/South America, start off with 4 weeks of a homestay/language class in Guatemala or Nicaragua. It's a good value. Even if you speak Spanish okay, it will really help prepare you for a higher level of conversation. You'll also get to meet a lot of people who have been traveling around, get a good idea of places to go and what to skip.\\n\\nThere will also likely be volunteer opportunities that you can arrange once you get there. Talk to the people at the school or your home stay about volunteer options. I never had a problem finding places to provide some hours, and its another chance to meet some locals. \\n\\nI think another mistake a lot of new travelers make is jumping from place to place, trying to fit everything in (you never will).

       " '**So you found a good deal on a 3rd party website**\\n\\n[But is it legit? Read this thread on how I determine if a 3rd party is legit.](https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/lvu6yj/booked_flight_through_travel_site_confirmation/gpe319j/)\\n\\nFrom that thread:\\n\\nAdding onto this, here is how I scope out companies to see if they are legit:\\n\\n* Read through the T&Cs, Privacy Policy, and disclaimers. A site with a ton of disclaimers in the footer is a read flag. A site with simple T&Cs, or Privacy Policy that isn\\'t full of a ton of legalese should be viewed as suspect. Look at a legit company\\'s T&Cs/Privacy Policy to start seeing what SHOULD be in there. Heck even looking at the length between Expedia and Travomint shows a clear difference. Any company that doesn\\'t have an army of lawyers that wrote an insanely lengthy T&Cs is probably working with very few resources.\\n\\n* This one is a little harder, but does their webpage seem pretty cookie cutter? Does it seem like a Wordpress or Shopfy theme? You can even inspect the page with google inspect, and look at the sources. What stuff is there? For example, I can see Travomint is using a 34 dollar theme, pretty much out of the box with sample stock photos: https://www.cssigniter.com/themes/cousteau-pro/. You can also right click and do a google image search and see if they are using stock photography. If the stock photography is from a legit paid service, okay. But if its from a freebie site that also shows they lack resources and possibly any care to copyright laws.\\n\\n* Check the domain registration, see when it was registered. https://lookup.icann.org/ (Although many companies pay a 3rd party to register like GO Daddy so it will just point to the register). But also look through the website to see if it lists any DBA (doing business as) or \"Affiliate\" or Part of the X network or whatever and then lookup those company\\'s they list.\\n* Look the company up on Linkedin. How many employees do they have? Where are the employees located? Not many employees? This might indicate that someone is trying to make a quick buck standing up a simple website (very easy to do) and then using basic travel APIs (usually you have to pay for these) to serve up pricing. It will also mean they likely do not have any support staff, so if anything goes wrong you are SOL.\\n\\n* Speaking of pricing and APIs, Any site that says pricing isn\\'t accurate or that it can \"Fluctuate\" or may change after booking STAY THE FUCK AWAY. If they are so fucking cheap they cannot run a proper 3rd party OTA with up to date prices, then they cut corners everywhere else.\\n\\n* Check out their social pages. See how often they use them. How they use them. How many followers. Facebook will have a \"Page Transparency\" thing on one of the siderails. Click it to see Admins, when the page was created. If the page has changed names. You can also click in and see some recent ads. What ads are they running?\\n\\n* From there I may then start to look at reviews. Remember BBB is complete bullshit. Companies can pay to clean up or get a better rating. And a lot of those review-specific websites will have tons of fake reviews. Look and see how many reviews people leave. If they are getting a ton of 5 star reviews from people who have only reviewed them, count those out. Look at reddit. Trip advisor forms. Search social for mentions of the company. Etc.',\n",

We woke up at 7am and explored padang bai (walked to the beach, had local food, walked to a temple near by). Got to Gili T at 4:30/5PM checked in and just walked around the island. Stayed at Villa Unggul - for $128 (2 nights) \\n\\nDay 3: Woke up around 5:30am to see the beautiful Gili T beach sunrise, had lunch at the Banyan tree (highly recommend), fell in love with Lumbak peppers (we love spicy food) and biked around the island the entire day. Can’t remember how much it cost for bicycle rental for 2 people but i’m sure it wasn’t more than $10  \\n\\nDay 4: Woke up early for another sunrise in Gili T, biked around the island some more and took a ferry back to Bali around 2PMish. Booked another airbnb but this time near the airport since we were going to East Java the next day. Found a cab driver that took us to the airbnb for approx $25\\n\\n\\n*Days 5-7 booked with tour guide $300 for tour, stay, breakfast*\\n\\nDay 5: Arrive at East Java (approx 11am) - visit malang wonosari tea plantation, color fun village, and go to Tumpak Sewu area and stay over night\\nDay 6: Start early morning, sunrise at tumpak sewu, tubing nirvana, goa tees, tapas biru waterfall, and we were SCHEDULED to travel to ijen view hotel but found out that ijen crater was closed so we booked a flight out to Bali. We asked our tour guide for recommendation on a driver in Bali and this person became our driver the next few days. We got the last flight out to Bali that night (approx $40 pp) and reached out to our hotel (menzel ubud) for an extra night ($25 for driver from bali airport to ubud). \\n\\n***Note we did get a refund of $75 because ijen crater was closed and we decided just to go to bali*\\n\\n\\nDay 7: Slept in till 8am and then reached out to our driver from the night before to get recommendations on what to do. We were so tired from the tumpak sewu hike so we decided this was our relax day. We went out and booked some massages (2 people $40) and then came back and relaxed\\n\\nDay 8: 8AM start - Driver picked us up and took us everywhere - Bali Swing, Lempuyang Temple and Tirta Gangga $45.00 for driver. Entrance fees: $60\\nDay 9: Tanah Lot temple, GWK (culture park), Uluwatu Temple $40 for driver and $20ish for entrance. Once we got back to our hotel we got an email that our flight was canceled and we got messages from our relatives stating everything was closing down. This is when we decided that we need to pack up and come back. After a frustrating 3 hours we booked a flight for the next day.\\nDay 10: Relaxed by the pool at our hotel until it was time to go to the airport. Our driver took us and he told us not to pay for the drive. We tipped him very generously and still continue to chat with him and send him and his family money on special occasions (Diwali & Christmas) \\n\\nTotal: $828 - not including flights and tips. Food cost us approximately $400. As a vegetarian i loved eating in Bali and Gili T - it was a little harder for me in East Java. I relied mostly on fruits. The food my husband had in East Java was approx $3-5 per meal. Breakfast was included everywhere and we had lounge access in the airport so when we were traveling to and from east java we had lunch/dinner at the lounge. \\n\\n\\nFor the flight and last hotel in Bali we booked through miles. The last hotel in bali (menzel ubud) was our honeymoon suite so we did splurge a little more. The food at Menzel Ubud was AMAZING - highly recommend it. \\n\\n\\nOverall, there were a few things we were scheduled to do which we will have to go back to Indonesia for: Ijen Crater, Tegalalang Rice Terrance, Tegenungan Waterfall, Trekking at Batur Mountain, Trekking at Mount Bromo (this wasn’t on our list but it’s now added), Nusa Peneda Island, and Lombok Island (also not on our initial list but after having those peppers we really want to go visit). \\n\\n\\n\\nThis was the best trip of my life.

My partner's father also helped fill in the gaps regarding the socio hierarchy when it came to chinese descendents and native indonesians when he was growing up.  \\n\\nI would love to go back and spend more time away from Java and Bali and explore the other smaller islands.\",\n",

    "# Stretch goal (bonus-ish)\n",
    "### Although this is not formally a bonus for points, it is a learning opportinity.  You are not required to complete the following part of this notebook for the assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our sentiment analysis technique above works, but has some shortcomings.  The biggest shortcoming is that each word is treated individually.  But what if we have a sentence with a negation?  For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "'This is not a bad thing.'\n",
    "\n",
    "This sentence should be positive overall, but AFINN only has the word 'bad' in the dictionary, and so the sentence gets an overall negative score of -3.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most accurate sentiment analysis methods use neural networks to capture context as well as semantics.  The drawback of NNs is they are computationally expensive to train and run.\n",
    "\n",
    "An easier method is to use a slightly-improved sentiment analysis technique, such as TextBlob or VADER (https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment) in Python.  Both libraries use a hand-coded algorithm with word scores like AFINN, but also with additions like negation rules (e.g. a word after 'not' has it's score reversed).\n",
    "\n",
    "Other sentiment analysis libraries in Python can be read about here: https://www.iflexion.com/blog/sentiment-analysis-python\n",
    "\n",
    "### The stretch goal\n",
    "The stretch goal is to use other sentiment analysis libraries on the Reddit data we collected, and compare the various approaches (AFINN word-by-word, TextBlob, and VADER) using plots and statistics.  For the AFINN word-by-word approach, you will need to either sum up the sentiment scores for each comment, or average them.  You might also divide them by 5 to get the values between -1 and +1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a brief example of getting scores from the 3 methods described above.  We can see while the raw AFINN approach gives a score of -0.6 (if normalized), TextBlob shows 0.35 and VADER shows 0.43."
